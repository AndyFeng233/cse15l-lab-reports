These are the changes that I made to improve the program. 

## Links to the failure-inducing test files
To test the program, I created four different test files.
1. Originally, the test file has a few empty lines at the end of the test file, which causes the program to crush. After deleting the empty lines, the program gives the correct outputs. Basically, the file tests if the program will run and return an  expected output of link. [Failure-inducingTestFiles](https://github.com/AndyFeng233/markdown-parser/blob/main/test-file.md)

2. The test file is going to test if the program will return multiple expected link without returning the flaw ones. [TestMultipleLink](https://github.com/AndyFeng233/markdown-parser/blob/main/test-file1.md)

3. The test file checks if the program will return the unexpected link as an outpu. [TestSingleFlawLink](https://github.com/AndyFeng233/markdown-parser/blob/main/testfile2.md)

4. The test file aims to test if the program will return the image link. [ImageTest](https://github.com/AndyFeng233/markdown-parser/blob/main/testImage.md)
